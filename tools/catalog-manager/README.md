# Internal catalog feed importer

This local Node tool converts a supplier XML export into **review-only** Chiriko
product drafts. It does not contact a remote feed, download images, alter
`src/data/products.ts`, or publish anything to the storefront.

## Run it

1. Create `tools/catalog-manager/input/` locally.
2. Put the XML file there, for example as `feed.xml`.
3. From the repository root, run:

   ```sh
   node tools/catalog-manager/import-feed.mjs ./tools/catalog-manager/input/feed.xml
   ```

The generated file is `tools/catalog-manager/output/product-drafts.json`.
Both the input and output directories are ignored by Git. The output contains
public-shaped drafts only, but it remains local so that every record can be
checked before selected records are manually copied into
`src/data/products.ts`.

The importer recognizes `<product>`, `<item>`, and `<article>` records, including
the Be Lenka/Venalio merchant feed structure. Merchant-feed items may each be a
single SKU/size row, so the importer first creates safe intermediate rows and
then groups them into one product/color draft by normalized brand, commercial
model/name, and color. It never creates a separate Chiriko product merely
because the size or item group differs.

Imported size labels go into `consultableSizes` only; `sizes` stays empty
because feed availability is not a customer stock guarantee. Prices are
intentionally not imported until Chiriko confirms a safe public
customer-facing field, so every draft has `price: 0` and requires review.
Stock quantities are never published, and every record defaults to `preorder`.
The generated output is review-only and never updates the storefront by itself.

## Security and review checklist

Never commit:

- supplier feed URLs or credentials;
- `.env` files, tokens, API keys, or other secrets;
- the source XML or other private B2B exports;
- wholesale prices, supplier cost, margin data, retail-price formulas, private
  terms, stock quantities, or logistics notes;
- generated output without first moving only approved, public-safe fields into
  the catalog by hand.

Keep all supplier pricing, costs, margins, availability details, and internal
calculations outside `src/`, `public/`, HTML, and every frontend bundle. Do not
add a feed request to React code. If local URL support is added later, keep the
URL and credentials in an uncommitted `.env` and perform the request only from
an internal Node tool.

Before using any draft, verify its title, grouping, category, color, image URLs,
sizes, customer-facing price, and status. Remove placeholders and confirm that
descriptions contain no private supplier information. Copy approved objects to
`src/data/products.ts` manually; running this importer never changes the public
catalog.
